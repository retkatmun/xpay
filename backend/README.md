# FundX backend

One API, two front doors: the Next.js web app and an Africa's Talking USSD flow.

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for why it's shaped this way.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run db:up          # Postgres 18 in Docker, on 5433
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev            # :4000
```

`.env` is generated on first run with a dev mnemonic and secrets (mode 600, gitignored).
`CHAIN_ADAPTER=mock` by default — balances live in Postgres and no chain is contacted.

```bash
curl localhost:4000/health
# {"ok":true,"chain":"mock","addressesReady":24,"ussd":"POST /"}
```

## Tests

Both run against a live server (`npm run dev` in another terminal):

```bash
node test/api.e2e.mjs     # 38 checks — web signup, login, send, idempotency, history
node test/ussd.e2e.mjs    # 64 checks — menu, register, balance, crypto+fiat, off-ramp, PIN, retry
```

The USSD test speaks the real Africa's Talking wire format: form-encoded `sessionId` /
`serviceCode` / `phoneNumber` / `text`, with `text` accumulating across hops exactly as the
gateway sends it.

## The rule this codebase is built around

`http/api` and `http/ussd` contain **no business rules and no chain calls**. Each parses its
own format, calls the same service function, and formats the result.

```
POST /api/transfers ─┐
                     ├─→ transfers.send({ from, recipient, amount, pin, idempotencyKey })
POST /  (USSD)      ─┘
```

Every option on the handset has a web endpoint too — `POST /api/payouts` for off-ramp and
fiat, `POST /api/auth/pin` for the PIN change — so neither door can quietly grow a capability
the other lacks.

That is the one lesson worth taking from `shaaibu7/FundX`, which does the opposite: all of
its logic lives inside a single Express handler, so `createUser`, `getBalance` and `transfer`
don't exist as callable functions and a web API would mean writing everything twice.

A consequence worth noticing: a user who signs up on a feature phone can log in on the web
with the same PIN, and their USSD transfer shows up in the web history. Both e2e suites
assert it.

## Menu

```
CON Welcome to FundX Wallet
1. Create an account      name -> passcode (handle generated from the name)
2. Check wallet balance   one hop, no PIN — the SIM is the authentication for a read
3. Transfer               1. Crypto (FundX user)  2. Fiat (bank account)
4. Off-ramp               withdraw to your own bank; the bank is remembered
5. Change PIN             current -> new -> confirm
```

### ⚠️ The naira legs are simulated

Options 3→2 and 4 quote a rate, debit the dollar balance and write a `payouts` row — but
**no payout rail is connected**, so nothing reaches a bank. Rows land as `status:
"simulated"`, deliberately not `"paid"`, so nothing downstream can mistake a demo for a
settled transfer. Connecting Paystack, Flutterwave or Monnify means replacing `dispatch()`
in `services/payouts.ts` and nothing else.

The dollar debit is real even so. A demo where the balance never moves teaches the wrong
thing about what an off-ramp costs.

## Keys

```
user #42's key = HDNodeWallet.fromMnemonic(MASTER_MNEMONIC, "m/44'/994'/0'/0").deriveChild(42)
```

**Nothing derived is ever stored.** Postgres holds `derivation_index` and the address; the
key is reconstructed in memory to sign and then discarded. A database dump leaks who the
users are — a real privacy incident — but leaks no funds. Losing the database is survivable
too: the seed plus a rescan rebuilds every address.

For contrast, the reference implementation AES-encrypts each private key using the first half
of that same key, and stores the key beside the ciphertext in the same column. Anyone with
read access to `users` can decrypt every wallet with the repo's own function.

### What measurement changed

Three things about Quai derivation that the docs don't tell you, each found by testing:

**The path is `m/44'/994'/0'/0/i`** — coin type 994. Verified by reproducing
`QuaiHDWallet.addAddress(0, i)` exactly.

**Most indices are unusable, and `addAddress` throws for them** — 39 of the first 40, with
"Failed to derive a valid address zone". When it does succeed it may hand back a different
zone: index 0 of a fresh seed came back Paxos-1.

**Checking `address.startsWith("0x00")` is wrong, and fails dangerously.** Over 3,137 indices,
10 addresses matched that prefix and only **5 were usable** — the rest were Cyprus-1 on the
*Qi* ledger, a UTXO ledger with no contracts where tokens are unrecoverable. A 50%
false-positive rate silently handing users an address that eats their money. The correct test
is all nine leading bits, the same predicate MockUSDT enforces on-chain:

```ts
BigInt(address) >> 151n === 0n
```

### Why there's an address pool

Finding a Cyprus-1 address costs **~566ms of blocking CPU** — roughly 512 derivations. In a
single-threaded runtime that would stall every other request, so a background filler keeps
`address_pool` stocked and signup claims a row with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.

## USSD

`text` accumulates across hops — `""`, `"1"`, `"1*chidi"`, `"1*chidi*12.50"`. It is tempting
to derive the menu position from `text.split("*").length`, and that is what the reference
implementation does. It cannot work: two flows at the same depth are indistinguishable, and a
retried hop replays whatever side effect that depth performs.

So `text` supplies **only the latest input**, and position lives in `ussd_sessions` keyed by
`sessionId`. Three rules follow, each a bug in the implementation this was modelled on:

| Rule | Their behaviour |
|---|---|
| Identical `text` replays the stored reply without re-executing | `sessionId` destructured and never used — a retried final hop sends money twice |
| Every state has a default that re-prompts | Falls through every branch, `response` stays `undefined`, handset shows a blank failure |
| Validation failures re-prompt with `CON` | `END` on a bad amount or wrong PIN — one mistyped digit means redialling |

Screens are budgeted to ~160 characters, with interpolated names truncated rather than
allowed to overflow.

### Settling inside the session

Quai finalises in ~5s and a USSD session lasts ~20s, so a confirmed receipt on the handset is
usually achievable — that is the specific reason this product can exist here. But it can't be
assumed. The adapter waits on a bounded budget (`CONFIRM_BUDGET_MS`, default 8s): confirmed
inside it, the handset shows the new balance; past it, the session ends with "we'll text you"
and SMS carries the result. The reference implementation calls `await tx.wait()` with no
bound, which times its own sessions out.

### Callback security

The callback is `POST /` — the bare root, matching the reference. It moves money on the
strength of a `phoneNumber` in a POST body, so anyone holding the URL can claim to be any
subscriber.

What keeps that from being a drain path is the PIN: argon2id, constant-time, with an attempt
counter and a lockout. The reference stores its PIN as a plaintext `INTEGER` compared with
`!=` and rate-limits nothing, which is what turns the same open route into an exhaustible
10,000-guess search. **An Africa's Talking IP allowlist still belongs in front of this in
production** — that is the real mitigation.

## Chain

`ChainAdapter` with two implementations, chosen by `CHAIN_ADAPTER`:

- **`mock`** — balances in Postgres. Enforces the same shard guard, so code that works here
  works there. What it cannot do is produce a transaction anyone can verify, which is the
  product's central claim — so it is temporary by design.
- **`quai`** — `quais` against Orchard. Written against the ABI the contract tests exercise.

**Not yet exercisable.** Every Quai faucet hostname is dead — `orchard.faucet.quai.network`,
`faucet.quai.network` and `faucet.qu.ai` have no DNS record and the official support article
404s, while the RPC and explorer both return 200. So the deployer has no gas, MockUSDT is not
deployed, and `mock` is the only adapter that can run. Switching is `CHAIN_ADAPTER=quai` plus
`MOCK_USDT_ADDRESS` once there is gas.

## Still to do

- **Chain indexer** — tail `Transfer` events into Postgres. Quai ships no indexer
  (`subgraph` and `indexer` are zero hits across its docs), so this database *is* the indexer.
  Needed for external deposits and for the "we'll text you" path to ever fire.
- **Frontend wiring** — replace the mock bodies in `lib/api/index.ts` with `fetch`, add a
  login screen, handle 401, thread `balance.ngnRate` through instead of the hardcoded default.
- **Rate limiting** per MSISDN and per IP.
